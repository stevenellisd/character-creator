# Character Creator

The Character Generator audience and functionality specifics can be customized as you wish. This can be a tool used for specific tabletop roleplaying game characters or specific video game characters. It can be used as a source of inspiration for improv actors or for writers looking for character prompts. You must complete the user stories, following the requirements as laid out, with your audience and specified character functionality in mind. 

#User stories 

As a user I can create multiple characters. 

As a user I can view description of one character at a time that I have created. 

As a user I can view descriptions of all characters I have created. 

As a user I can edit existing character descriptions. 

As a user I can randomly generate character descriptions. 

# Stretch

As a user I can choose to randomly generate specific aspects of a character while choosing other aspects to customize on my own (e.g., randomly generate hair color while choosing my characterâ€™s eye color). 

As a user I can input my own character aspect details (e.g., I can input that my character has pink hair rather than choosing from a list of options). 

As a user, I can log in to my account.

# Requirements 

Characters must have at least 10 aspects (e.g., hair color, eye color, strength number, agility number, personality traits). Reminder that allowing user input for aspect details is a stretch goal. A list of user options for each aspect is acceptable. 

Application must have some form of persistence.

Application must have a UI. (Custom UI for Salesforce)

Application must be built using technologies from the training of individuals in the group. Where there is deviation in tech (e.g., Angular and React), choose one.

# Stretch

Application can be deployed. 

NOTES 

Login capability is a stretch goal. Visualizations of characters is not required.
